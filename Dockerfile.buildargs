# This is an example of how to build a Go app that depends on packages
# that are hosted in a private git repo using credentials specified by
# build arguments.

ARG ACCESS_TOKEN_PWD="nothing"

# git is required to fetch go dependencies
RUN apk add --no-cache ca-certificates git

# Create the user and group files that will be used in the running container to
# run the process as an unprivileged user.

# Fetch dependencies first; they are less susceptible to change on every build
# and will therefore be cached for speeding up the next build

# Build the executable to `/app`. Mark the build as statically linked.
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build \
